methodology for preliminar design and operation analysis of a centrifugal compressor for air-breathing environment

application of 1D meanline approach for the preliminary design of a centrifugal compressor for air breathing applications

  inlet total pressure              : p00 = 101325 [Pa]
  
  
  inlet total temperature           : T00 = 20 [Â°C] = 293.15 [K]
  
  
  gas constant                      : R = 288 [J/kgK]
  
  
  
  design rotational speed           : n = 25000 [rpm]
  
  
  design mass flowrate              : m = 3 [kg/s]
  
  
  design total-total pressure ratio : betaTT = 2.5 [-]
  
  
  design impeller diameter          : D2 = 350 [mm]
  
  
  
  design specific diameter          : Ds = 3.817 [-]
  
  
  design specific speed             : omegaS = 0.807 [-]
  
  
  from Balje chart choice of centrifugal architecture is justified
